	<ul>
		<li>400g/14oz lean beef mince (10% fat or less)</li>
		<li>1 onion, chopped</li>
		<li>2 celery sticks, trimmed and thinly sliced</li>
		<li>2 carrots, peeled and diced</li>
		<li>400g tin chopped tomatoes</li>
		<li>2 tbsp tomato purée</li>
		<li>1 beef stock cube</li>
		<li>1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
		<li>1 tsp dried mixed herbs</li>
		<li>100g/3½oz frozen peas</li>
		<li>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Place a large, non-stick saucepan or flameproof casserole over a medium heat. Add the beef, onion, celery and carrots to the pan and cook for 5 minutes. Use a couple of wooden spoons to break up the meat as it cooks.</li>
		<li>Stir in the tomatoes, tomato purée, stock cube, Worcestershire sauce and mixed herbs. Refill the tomato tin with water and pour into the pan. Season with a good pinch of salt and plenty of pepper. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat, cover loosely and simmer gently for about 25 minutes, stirring regularly.</li>
		<li>Meanwhile, to make the topping, put the potatoes into a large saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat slightly and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the leeks, return to a simmer and cook for 2 minutes more, or until the potatoes are tender but not falling apart.</li>
		<li>Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7. Drain the potatoes and leeks and return to the pan. Roughly crush the potatoes with a fork. Season with a little salt and lots of pepper.</li>
		<li>Stir the peas into the beef mixture then spoon into a 2 litre/3½ pint shallow ovenproof dish. Using a large spoon, top the beef mixture with the crushed potatoes. There is no need to do it too neatly. Scatter the cheese over the top.</li>
		<li>Bake for 25–30 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the filling is bubbling. Serve.</li>
	</ol>
